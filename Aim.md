<h> Predict Catalog Retail </h>
The aim is to perform analysis to determine whether the retail company should print and send catalogs to its new customers

This will require analysing the historical customer data to determine predictor variables 
and then use them to build a linear regression model to determine the probability of incremental sales
if the catalogs are sent to the 250 new customers the company has newly procured.
