<h> <b>Predict Catalog Retail </b></h>
<p>
The aim is build a multiple variable linear regression model in Alteryx to determine whether a dummy retail company should invest in incremental advertising spending.
</p>

<p>
This will require analysis of the historical customer data to determine predictor variables 
and then use them to build a linear regression model to determine the probability of incremental sales
if the catalogs are sent to the 250 new customers the company has newly procured.
